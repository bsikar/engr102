The computer engineering industry night was very informative and helpful. We were taught that computing plays a critical role in most modern tech such as smartphones, social media, entertainment, finance, automation in vehicles, automation in buildings, consumer products and more. Before going to this DI Saturday I did not have much interest in computer engineering, but now that I know the computer engineering major is comprised of aspects from both the computer science and electrical engineering departments I find computer engineering a lot more interesting. With the 546 undergraduate enrollment and 78 faculty from the spring of 2022 it is a very competitive major and it has a fast track program which is great for someone like me. The average starting salary is $80,861 which is although a lot has room to grow up to 125k at some companies. Computing the backbone of the majority of stem programs since 76% of jobs in stem has some aspect of computing. The major is very well versed and offers over 30 electives to choose from as well as many minors. Some of the minors offered include math, cyber security, game design, computer science, and electrical engineering. In my free time I program a lot and the classes I would be taking next year if I pursue this major are very interesting to me as they include coding in c++ in CSCE120, discrete structure, data structures and algorithms, digital systems design, and electrical circuit theory. Over all this major has a lot to offer and is nice for those who are debating between computer science and electrical engineering.
