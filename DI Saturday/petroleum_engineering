Petroleum engineering has to be one of the most interesting engineering majors out there from reservoir engineering, drilling and completions engineering to production engineering and petroleum evaluation and economics. Petroleum engineering has a lot of space to grow in the future as a long term forecast showed a 40-50% increase in the supply of oil and gas in 2040. Petroleum engineering is essential to provide the worlds energy needs safely and in the most environmentally sound way. Texas A&M has the best undergraduate program in the nation for petroleum engineering and its very competitive. With only 40 professors and only around 300 undergraduates, being a petroleum engineer at Texas A&M is very special. The average salary is also the highest out of any engineering major with a nice $97,000 paycheck. There are many student organizations for those interested in petroleum engineering including SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers), AADE (America Association of Drilling Engineers) and more. There is a fast track for the major and every student must have a summer internship to graduate. The aggie network is amazing and will enable students to get an internship and get real world experience. Many aspects of petroleum engineering bleed into other majors such as problem solving, math, science,  communication, finance, business, economics, and politics with world events. I know that I am definitely interested in petroleum engineering after learning that there is a lot of data science  aspects and opportunities in petroleum engineering since companies want to make sure they are not losing money in any parts of the engineering process.
